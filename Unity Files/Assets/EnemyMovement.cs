    /* **************Explanation and Hints************
     * Rigidbody - When attached to a GameObject it adds things like gravity as well as other physics properties to the GameObject.
     *             For the player we want to attach the Rigidbody to it so that we can add a forward force to it when pressing the up arrow key
     *           - To use the Rigidbody we need a variable. The type of this variable is "Rigidbody" instead of "int" and often this variable
     *             is named "rigidbody".
     *           - Now we need to get the reference to the Rigidbody. If we don't then it won't work. In order to get the reference we need to
     *             type in the Start function:
     *             
     *              *nameOfRigidbodyVariable* = GetComponent<Rigidbody>(); 
     *              
     *             Replace *nameOfRigidbodyVariable* with whatever name you gave the rigidbody variable.
     *             
     * Vector3 - It's a variable that groups "x", "y", and "z" together. In this script we will be assigning a new Vector3 value with the random direction
     *           We'll do this by typing:
     *           
     *           *directionVariable* = new Vector(0, Random.Range(0, 360), 0);
     *           
     *           After we do with we'll want to assign this to the eulerAngles.
     *           
     * Forward Direction - This represents the forward direction that the object is currently facing. In this case we will want to times the forward
     *                     direction with the speed to move the enemy forward. To get this value we need to type:
     * 
     *                      transform.forward
     *           
     * EulerAngles - There are two way to represent rotation in Unity. The first one is Quaternion and the second is EulerAngles. In this script we
     *               will be using the eulerAngles that's in transform since eulerAngles are easier to understand. Basically a eulerAngle is a
     *               Vector3 where the values of x, y, and z go from 0 to 360. So in this case if y has a value of 180 then this GameObject will
     *               be rotated 180 degrees on the y axis. In other words it will turn around. To assign a value to eulerAngles we'll type:
     *               
     *               transform.eulerAngles = *directionVariable*
     *               
     *               Replace *directionVariable* with the Vector3 direction variable that has a random value for the y axis.
     *              
     * AddRelativeForce - This will add a force relative to the direction of this GameObject. It is also a part of Rigidbody. In this script
     *                    we want to add force to the forward direction of this GameObject times the speed variable;
     *                  - We'll do this by typing:
     *                  
     *                    *rigidbodyVariable*.AddRelativeForce(transform.forward * speed);
     */
